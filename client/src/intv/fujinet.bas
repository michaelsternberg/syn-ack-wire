' fujinet.bas -- the FujiNet cartridge's mailbox: a transaction waited on
' (fn_transact) or posted and looked for later (fn_post, fn_check), the
' network device's open and close, and AppKeys.
'
' From M.U.L.E.'s Intellivision client (fujinet-multiplayer-mule,
' clients/intv/fujinet.bas and netpost.bas, GPL-3.0), cut to what this game
' uses. The mailbox layout is fujinet-firmware's
' pico/intellivision/firmware/include/fuji_mailbox.h.
'
' MEMATTR stops at $9BFF, short of the mailbox at $9C00: jzIntv's --fujinet
' peripheral registers its handler for $9C00-$9FFF after the cartridge's
' RAM, and whichever registered first answers, so declaring $8000-$9FFF
' would hide the mailbox in the emulator. The real cartridge maps that
' window itself, whatever the .cfg says.
